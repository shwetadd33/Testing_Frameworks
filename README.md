# Testing Frameworks

This repository is dedicated to documenting different testing frameworks as I learn them. The goal is to build a comprehensive collection of frameworks, complete with setup instructions, examples, and notes on best practices.

## Frameworks Included

- ### pytest - 
  The first testing framework added to this repository, focusing on Python test automation.
  
  **Description**: A popular testing framework for Python that simplifies writing and organizing test cases.\
  
  **Features**: Supports fixtures, assertions, and plugins.

  **Installation**:
  ```bash
  pip install pytest
  ```
  **Example**:
  ```python
  def test_addition():
    assert 2 + 3 == 5
   ```

Iâ€™ll be adding new frameworks as I continue to expand my knowledge in software testing.

Stay tuned for more updates!
