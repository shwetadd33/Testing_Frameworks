# Pytest Framework Training Files

This repository contains files and examples created as part of my training with the **Pytest** testing framework. The goal of this repository is to practice and explore various features of Pytest for writing effective unit tests using Python.

## Overview

Pytest is a powerful testing framework for Python that makes it easy to write simple, scalable, and maintainable test cases. In this repository, I document my journey learning Pytest by creating various test examples, exercises, and code samples that demonstrate the framework's features.

The repository covers Pytest topics such as:
- Writing basic test functions
- Assertions and comparing results
- Using fixtures for setup and teardown
- Parametrizing tests
